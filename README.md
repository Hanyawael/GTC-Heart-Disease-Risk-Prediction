## 📌 Overview

This project is part of the **GTC (Genius Technology Center)**.  
The goal is to build a **Machine Learning model** that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient health data.  
It applies **data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ML algorithms** to classify whether a patient is at risk.

## 🚀 Features

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns
* Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding, normalization
* Feature selection and correlation analysis
* Training and evaluation of multiple ML models
* Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Visualizations for insights (heatmaps, distribution plots, ROC curves)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains patient health records with features such as:  
Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG results, Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise-induced Angina, Oldpeak (ST depression), Number of vessels colored by fluoroscopy, Thalassemia, and Target (Heart disease presence).
