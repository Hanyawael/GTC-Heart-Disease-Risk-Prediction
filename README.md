# Heart Disease Risk Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of the **GTC (Genius Technology Center)**.
The goal is to build a **Machine Learning model** that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient health data.
It applies **data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ML algorithms** to classify whether a patient is at risk.
